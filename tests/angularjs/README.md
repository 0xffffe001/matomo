## Installation:

npm install .

## Used libs
MochaJS + expect.js (might use chai instead of expect.js)

## Execution

Run tests (it runs tests automatically again once there is a file change)
`karma start karma.conf.js`

It runs the tests in PhantomJS and Chrome at the moment, we might change it soon.
