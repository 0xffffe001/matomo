Using this 'archive.php' script is no longer recommended.
Please use '/path/to/php /home/travis/build/piwik/piwik/tests/PHPUnit/proxy/../../..//console core:archive --url=http://localhost/tests/PHPUnit/proxy/index.php' instead.
To get help use '/path/to/php /home/travis/build/piwik/piwik/tests/PHPUnit/proxy/../../..//console core:archive --help'
See also: http://piwik.org/docs/setup-auto-archiving/

If you cannot use the console because it requires CLI
try 'php archive.php --url=http://your.piwik/path'
